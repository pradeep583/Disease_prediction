# Corn Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify corn leaf images into different disease categories. Built using TensorFlow and deployed with Flask, the model can help farmers or agritech platforms quickly detect corn plant diseases from leaf images.

## Features

- Trained deep learning model (`.keras` format)
- Web interface for image upload and prediction
- TensorFlow Lite support for low-resource deployment
- Real-time prediction with confidence scores
- Minimal UI & efficient memory usage
